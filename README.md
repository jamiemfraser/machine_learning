# IBM Machine Learning Professional Certificate

This repository contains projects from the IBM Machine Learning Professional Certificate from Coursera. I completed the course in August 2021. Skills developed include:

* Exploratory data analysis for machine learning
* A theoretical overview of machine learning techniques and the history of their development
* Supervised and unsupervised learning techniques, including data preprocessing
* Feature engineering
* Deep learning reinforcement learning models
* Time series modeling for prediction

The projects I completed as part of this Professional Certificate demonstrating the following skills:

* Analysing country economic conditions to inform data driven decision making for cargo carriers
* Performed exploratory data analysis
* Used supervised learning techniques, such as LASSO regression and KNN classifiers
* Used unsupervised learning techniques, such as K Means clustering and Heirarchical Agglomerative clustering
